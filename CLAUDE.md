Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository.

## Project: Flyto MLX

Flyto MLX is a brand-independent fork of **oMLX** — an MLX-based LLM inference
engine and OpenAI-compatible server for Apple Silicon. It serves LLM / VLM /
audio models, with speculative decoding (DFlash), KV-cache tiering, oQ
quantization, grammar-constrained structured output (xgrammar), and an admin UI.

- GitHub `panwudi/flyto-mlx` (Gitee mirror, hourly). PyPI `flyto-mlx`.
- CLI main name `fmlx`; `omlx` kept as an alias for upstream-script compat.
- Renamed from `panwudi/omlx` on 2026-05-16.

### Upstream relationship — soft fork

Upstream is `jundot/omlx` (`upstream` git remote). We **soft-fork**: cherry-pick
upstream bug fixes and new-model support; we do **not** PR our own features back.
Sync workflow: `git fetch upstream && git log upstream/main..main`, cherry-pick
selectively (`-x`), and record every import/skip decision in
`docs/upstream-sync.md`. To check whether an upstream commit is already in,
actually `git cherry-pick` it (a "nothing to commit" means it is) — `git cherry`
and grep both mis-report.

## Conventions

- **Commit messages are bilingual.** Subject in English; body = English text,
  then a `---` line on its own, then the Chinese version. No exceptions.
- **No AI trailers in commits** — no "Generated with…", no `Co-Authored-By`
  AI lines, no tool attribution.
- Chinese docs / release notes: plain prose — no emoji, no stacked sub-headers,
  no marketing phrasing, no decorative parallel bullet lists.
- Single `main` trunk = sole deploy + release branch. Develop on `feat/*`,
  rebase onto `main`, then merge. No long-lived half-finished branches.
- Commit / push only when asked.

## Standing authorizations (AI workflow)

These are durable, repo-scoped grants. They override the default "ask before
destructive / shared-state operation" rule for this repo only.

- **AI may self-merge own PRs from `sync/*` branches into `main`** when ALL of:
  1. Branch name matches `sync/*` (AI-opened upstream-sync or AI-driven fix
     workflow, not human-authored feature branches).
  2. Full test suite was run on the branch; only failures are the known
     pre-existing set (see `docs/upstream-sync.md` baseline). Zero regression.
  3. PR body has a Test plan section with the targeted-test list AND the
     full-suite numbers (pass / fail / skip) AND an explicit "zero regression"
     statement tied to the baseline.
  4. Use `merge_method: "merge"` (preserve atomic cherry-pick history) — NOT
     squash, NOT rebase. flyto's `git log --grep="cherry picked from"` workflow
     depends on atomic commits surviving into main.
  5. Merge commit subject + body follow the bilingual convention.

- **AI may force-push to its own `sync/*` branches** when rebasing AI-authored
  commits before the PR is merged. Once a PR is merged the branch is read-only
  history.

- **AI may NOT self-merge feature branches** (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, anything not
  matching `sync/*`) or any branch opened by a human.

- **AI may NOT push directly to `main`.** Always via PR, even with the
  self-merge grant above.

## Machines

- The Flyto MLX server runs only on **m5max** at `~/Code/omlx`, launched by
  `/Applications/Flyto MLX.app` -- a thin Swift menubar shell whose source lives
  in this repo at `apps/omlx-mac` (bundle dir/MachO still named `oMLX`). The
  shell embeds no Python; it shells out to the host venv
  `~/Code/omlx/.venv/bin/python -m omlx.cli serve` (see `PythonRuntime.swift`),
  so editing a `.py` in the worktree + restarting the server applies instantly.
  The local clone dir is named `omlx`; it is this `flyto-mlx` repo.
- **m2max is a dev machine only.** Its server, app, cluster router and models
  were removed on 2026-10-10 (it had been down since late September with no
  traffic). Keep `~/Code/omlx` + `.venv` there for development and tests; do
  not deploy to it. The m5max cluster router (`:9000`) now has m5max as its
  only backend.
- Rebuilding the menubar shell: `apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh` (needs Xcode;
  emits a few-MB `build/Stage/oMLX.app`, version tracked from `omlx/_version.py`).
  Deploy by replacing `/Applications/Flyto MLX.app` (`ditto` + `codesign --force
  --sign -` + `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`), then relaunch. Base-path default
  is `apps/omlx-mac/Sources/Config/AppConfig.swift` `defaultBasePath()`.
- `omlx serve` binds `settings.server.host` at startup; settings live at
  `~/.fmlx/settings.json` (a legacy `~/.omlx -> ~/.fmlx` compat symlink is kept
  so old absolute paths still resolve). A config change needs a genuine
  server-process restart to take effect.
